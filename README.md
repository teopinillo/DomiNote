# DomiNote

Hi:

 I made an app, for track the score in a Domino's game. When you play Dominos, you count the point on the face of the domino pieces from the team that lose, and the first team to get 100 points wins a match.
 On my app, insetad of putting numbers I put the dominos face, so the user only need to click in the face and the points are automatically added. When all the points are counted, the user must select where the points goes, to the home team or to the visitor team,(Buttons Home or Visitor). 
 If the user make any mistake, he can clear the add by pressing the clear button, and if the user want to start a whole new match can click on reset.
 Once one team score 100, automatically the scores are set to zero, and increment to one the numbers of win for that team.

Hope you like it

Teo
